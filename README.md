# PixelCollapse
We present a systematic approach to detect and extract information about satellite tracks in the fields of a high-cadence lensed quasar monitoring project with Omegacam on the Vlt Survey Telescope, without the use of reference images. A pixel collapse method is carried out for every possible direction Î± in order to detect the peaks in brightness indicating the presence of satellite or space debris tracks. We use a script called Predictsat to link the satellites or space debris that we detect to those present in the SpaceTrack database in order to access the information of the object responsible for the track, such as its name, its nature, the parameters of its orbit. We show the efficiency of our methods and the limit of detection using hand-added tracks by varying the length and brightness. We also compare the experimental results obtained with those expected statistically by assuming a uniform distribution of the satellites on the images.
